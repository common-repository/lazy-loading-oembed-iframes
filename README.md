Add the loading=lazy attribute to iframes coming from oEmbeds in content

## Description

This plugin adds the `loading=lazy` attribute to `iframe` elements coming from oEmbeds. In WordPress 5.5, `loading=lazy` is added to images per [#44427](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44427), and in 5.7 it is being added to iframes as well per [#50756](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50756).

This plugin will be obsolete by the time WordPress 5.7 is released. When that happens, this plugin will do nothing.
